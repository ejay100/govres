# GOVRES Open-Source Announcement

**GOVRES — A programmable reserve and settlement ledger for Ghana — is now open source.**

We’re inviting engineers, economists, civic technologists, and policymakers to collaborate on the GitHub repo:
- Repository overview & documentation: [README](../README.md)
- Contribution standards, coding style, and review flow: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Key Highlights
- **Public ledger core:** Permissioned TypeScript engine for GBDC (gold-backed) and CRDN (cocoa-receipt) instruments.
- **End-to-end stack:** Express API, oracle services, simulation suite, and React portals for BoG, banks, agencies, contractors, farmers, diaspora investors, and the public.
- **Deployment ready:** Docker Compose, GitHub Pages front-end pipeline, and automation-friendly scripts for migrations, seeds, and simulations.

## How to Collaborate
1. **Ideas & Roadmaps:** Start a GitHub Discussion (`Discussions` tab → “New Discussion”) to pitch new modules, integrations, or policy tooling.
2. **Features & Bugs:** Open a GitHub Issue with clear reproduction steps or RFC-style proposals. Use the `feature`, `bug`, or `compliance` labels where relevant.
3. **Pull Requests:** Follow the CONTRIBUTING guidelines; include tests, screenshots, and architecture notes.
4. **Working Groups:** Organize community sprints inside Discussions (tag as `working-group`) to tackle focus areas such as farmer UX, banking adapters, oracle feeds, or AML automation.
